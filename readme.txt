[h1] Story [/h1]
Since time immemorial, the world of Earth 9981 has been steeped in magic, though its presence was limited and not comprehended by many. That all changed in 1604 with the sudden appearance of the Magic Element, a source of immense power that filled the entire solar system, granting the ability to wield magic to every person on the planet, regardless of their background or social status.
With the surge of magic, two hidden societies - Tamar Kaj and Hogwarts - revealed themselves to the world. They had been dedicated to the study and mastery of magic for centuries, hiding among ordinary people. This event marked the beginning of the Age of Magic, a new era in human history.
In 1830, a second event occurred that increased the density of the Magic Element threefold leading to a proliferation of mages and the establishment of the first Magic Research Institute at the South Pole in 1836. The Institute paved the way for a new age of technological advancement and innovation. This new era was dubbed the Age of Wizardry.
mages became an integral part of society, with their use of magic became widespread in everyday life. Thanks to the equal distribution of magical abilities across the population, tensions were kept at bay and people of all walks of life were able to work together to build a better world.
As the Age of Wizardry continued to evolve, the use of magic becomes more refined and sophisticated, promising a bright future for Earth 9981 as mages and non-mages alike collaborate towards a common goal.
